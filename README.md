# Animations Demo React

I initially wanted to do this in svelte but it's a bit broken, so doing it in react for now

See it: https://ayroblu.github.io/animations-demo-react

## Ideas

- photo gallery
    - swipe up for info (half sheet?)
    - long press for popup info
    - pinch to zoom
    - black bar on edges to have separation between images
    - popup slightly too far then bounce back
    - scroll background contents when swiping through images
- placeholder tweet
- messages chat
    - Specifically the gradient on scroll
    - Perhaps also the pull effects when moving and on overscroll

## Other Ideas

- lock screen
    - drag down for search
    - long press to show notification in more detail
    - open apps / notifications / widgets animation
- unrelated: maintain scroll position on new item added

## Getting Started

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```
