# Animations Demo React

I initially wanted to do this in svelte but it's a bit broken, so doing it in react for now

See it: https://ayroblu.github.io/animations-demo-react

## Other ideas

- lock screen
    - notifications rotate in effect
    - notifications swipeable
    - home screen background, blur at 30%, icons appear at 50%, finish blur and transparent at 70%
        - Can't do due to dominance of home gesture
    - Swipe in from left widgets, blur and scale in the current screen
        - Also swipe right for camera
    - drag down for search
- messages chat
    - Specifically the gradient on scroll
    - Perhaps also the pull effects when moving and on overscroll
- photo gallery
- placeholder tweet

## Getting Started

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```
