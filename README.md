# Animations Demo React

I initially wanted to do this in svelte but it's a bit broken, so doing it in react for now

See it: https://ayroblu.github.io/animations-demo-react

## Ideas

- lock screen
    - notifications swipeable
    - drag down for search
- photo gallery
- placeholder tweet
- messages chat
    - Specifically the gradient on scroll
    - Perhaps also the pull effects when moving and on overscroll

## Other Ideas

- lock screen
    - drag down for search
    - long press to show notification in more detail
    - open apps / notifications / widgets animation

## Getting Started

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```
